# ESPSomfy

This repository provides an **external ESPHome component** to control Somfy motorised covers (and future device types). It uses a **hub architecture** where radio hardware is configured once in a `somfy:` hub block, and individual devices reference it via `somfy_id`. This makes it easy to add multiple covers sharing a single radio, and to extend with new platforms (switches, lights, etc.) in the future.

Two protocols are supported:

| Type | Protocol | Frequency | Modulation | Use case |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `rts` | Somfy RTS | 433.42 MHz | OOK (Manchester) | Standard Somfy remotes/motors |
| `iohc` 1W | io-homecontrol 1W | 868.95 MHz | 2-FSK, 38.4 kbaud | Newer Somfy motors (one-way control) |
| `iohc` 2W | io-homecontrol 2W | 868.25/868.95/869.85 MHz | 2-FSK, 38.4 kbaud | Bidirectional with status feedback |

## Architecture

```
somfy:              ← Hub (owns radio hardware)
  type: rts/iohc

cover:              ← Device (references hub)
  platform: somfy
  somfy_id: <hub>
```

The hub handles all radio TX/RX and protocol framing. Device classes (covers today, more in the future) handle device-specific logic (rolling codes, position tracking, pairing) and delegate radio operations to their hub.

## Required hardware

- **ESP32** (any variant)
- **For RTS:** any 433 MHz OOK TX/RX module + antenna, wired to a GPIO (via ESPHome's generic
  `remote_transmitter` / `remote_receiver`). This is just a bit-banged GPIO signal, not tied to any
  particular radio chip — a cheap FS1000A/RXB6-style module works fine, and so would an SX1262-based
  board's spare GPIO if you wired an external OOK module to it (the onboard SX1262 radio itself can't be
  used here — see below).
- **For iohc:** either
  - a CC1101 868 MHz module + antenna (via ESPHome's native `cc1101` component in packet mode), for
    full support of both 1W and 2W (bidirectional) modes; or
  - an SX1262 868 MHz radio (via ESPHome's native `sx126x` component), including boards with one
    built in like the [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3](https://devices.esphome.io/devices/heltec-wifi-lora-32-v3/)
    — **1W only**. 2W's 3-channel frequency hopping needs a faster retune than `sx126x`'s driver exposes,
    so 2W still requires a CC1101. `sx126x` also doesn't support OOK, so it can't be used for RTS.

    detected_remote: somfy_rx_last
    allowed_remotes:
      - 0x92FB39
```

### Pairing (PROG)

The ESPHome device acts like a new Somfy RTS remote identified by `remote_code`. Before it can control a motor, that motor must be paired:

1. Put the motor into *programming mode* using an **already paired** physical remote (hold PROG ~2 s until the motor jogs).
2. Within the programming window, press the **Prog ...** button in Home Assistant.
3. The motor jogs again to confirm pairing.

### Detecting remote IDs

1. Add a `text_sensor` (as above) and set `detected_remote` on the cover.
2. Press a button on the physical remote.
3. Read the decoded `0x......` ID from the text sensor.
4. Add it to `allowed_remotes` and recompile.

```

### Notes

- 1W commands (open/close/stop) are sent on **868.95 MHz** with the public io-homecontrol transfer key.
- The component handles CRC-16 (Kermit) and AES-128 HMAC in software.
- For bidirectional (2W) support, see the next section.

### Using an onboard SX1262 instead (1W only)

Boards with a built-in SX1262, like the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3, can drive IOHC 1W directly via
ESPHome's native `sx126x` component instead of a separate CC1101 module — see the full example in
[`somfy_iohc_1w_sx1262.yaml`](somfy_iohc_1w_sx1262.yaml). Swap the `cc1101:` block above for:

```yaml
sx126x:
  id: sx126x_radio
  cs_pin: GPIO8
  busy_pin: GPIO13
  dio1_pin: GPIO14
  rst_pin: GPIO12
  rf_switch: true
  hw_version: sx1262
  tcxo_voltage: 1_8V  # this board's SX1262 uses a TCXO, not a plain crystal
  tcxo_delay: 5ms
  modulation: FSK
  frequency: 868950000
  bitrate: 38400
  deviation: 19.2kHz
  bandwidth: 93_8kHz
  sync_value: [0x7F, 0xD9]
  crc_enable: false
  payload_length: 60
  rx_start: false

somfy:
  - id: iohc_radio
    type: iohc
    sx126x_id: sx126x_radio  # instead of cc1101_id
```

Covers on an `sx126x_id`-backed hub must use `mode: 1w` (the default) — `mode: 2w` is rejected at
compile time, since 2W's channel hopping isn't feasible with this radio (see Required hardware above).

### RX state-sync (sync with physical remotes)

Just like RTS, the iohc hub can keep Home Assistant in sync when a motor is
driven by an **original io-homecontrol remote**. The CC1101 is always listening,
so no extra receiver hardware is needed - just add a text sensor and/or an
allow-list to the cover:

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: template
    id: somfy_iohc_rx_last
    name: "Detected iohc Remote"

cover:
  - platform: somfy
    type: iohc
    id: bedroom_blind
    # ... other options ...
    somfy_id: iohc_radio
    detected_remote: somfy_iohc_rx_last
    allowed_remotes:
      - 0x112233
```

1. Set `detected_remote` and press a button on the physical remote.
2. Read the decoded `0x......` node ID from the text sensor.
3. Add it to `allowed_remotes` and recompile.

When a listed remote sends open/close/stop, the HA cover animates to match using
the configured `open_duration`/`close_duration` (assumed-state, time-based). An
empty `allowed_remotes` means *accept all* (discovery mode). RX-sync code is only
compiled in when `detected_remote` or `allowed_remotes` is configured.

<summary><h2>iohc configuration (2W - bidirectional)</h2></summary>

2W mode enables authenticated bidirectional communication with io-homecontrol actuators. The controller sends a command, the actuator replies with a cryptographic challenge, and the controller responds to prove it holds the system key. This provides command acknowledgement and status feedback.

### Requirements

- ESPHome 2026.4+ with native `cc1101` component in packet mode
- The **system key** (per-installation AES-128 key) - obtained during initial pairing or from a paired controller backup
- The actuator's **node address** (3-byte, e.g. `0xABCDEF`)

### Protocol overview

1. Controller sends CMD_EXECUTE (0x00) on 868.95 MHz
2. Actuator replies with challenge (CMD 0x3C, 6 random bytes) on one of 3 RX channels (868.25 / 868.95 / 869.85 MHz)
3. Controller computes AES-128-ECB response from IV (frame data + rolling checksum + challenge) and sends CMD 0x3D
4. Actuator validates and executes; sends status (CMD 0xFE) back

### Example configuration

```yaml
somfy:
  - id: iohc_radio
    type: iohc
    cc1101_id: cc1101_radio

cover:
  - platform: somfy
    type: iohc
    id: living_room_blind
    name: "Living Room Blind"
    device_class: shutter
    open_duration: 25s
    close_duration: 25s
    storage_key: KeyLivBlind
    remote_code: 0xAABBCC
    prog_button: program_living_room
    somfy_id: iohc_radio
    mode: 2w
    target_node: 0xDEADBE
    encryption_key: "YOUR_SYSTEM_KEY_HEX_32_CHARS_HERE"
```

### Additional cover options (2W)

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `mode` | no | `1w` (default) or `2w` |
| `target_node` | 2W only | 3-byte hex address of the target actuator |
| `encryption_key` | 2W only | System key (32-char hex AES-128 key) |

### Notes

- TX is always on **868.95 MHz**; RX hops across 3 channels (868.25 / 868.95 / 869.85 MHz) with 2.7 ms dwell time.
- The session has a 3-second timeout with up to 2 retries.
- Unlike 1W, 2W frames do not use a rolling code - authentication is challenge/response based.
- The system key is specific to your installation. It is **not** the public transfer key used by 1W.
- RX state-sync (`detected_remote` / `allowed_remotes`) also works in 2W: foreign remote -> motor commands are heard on the 868.95 MHz TX channel while the radio idles there. Verify decoding against your actuators on first use.

## Rolling codes & reflashing

RTS and iohc **1W** are *one-way* protocols with replay protection: every command
carries an incrementing counter (the "rolling code"), and the motor remembers the
last value it accepted and **rejects any command at or below it**. This component
persists that counter in the ESP's **NVS flash** under `storage_key`, so it
survives reboots and power loss.

> iohc 2W does **not** use a rolling code - it authenticates with a
> challenge/response handshake - so the rest of this section applies only to
> RTS and iohc 1W.

**The counter survives normal updates, but a clean/full erase resets it:**

| Action | Rolling-code counter |
|--------|----------------------|
| Reboot / power loss | preserved |
| **OTA** update (dashboard or wireless `esphome run`) | preserved |
| Serial `esphome run` (normal upload) | preserved |
| `esptool.py erase_flash` / "erase device" / flashing *from scratch* | **reset to 1** |
| Changing the partition table / NVS layout | reset/invalidated |

This is the trade-off of a *truly clean* reflash: a fresh flash means a **clean
NVS**, so the counter restarts at `1` while the motor still expects a much higher
value - and silently ignores the device until they're back in sync.

**Recovery is a single button press: re-pair.** Put the motor into programming
mode and press the **Prog ...** button (see *Pairing (PROG)* above). Pairing
re-enrols this `remote_code` and resets the motor's expected counter, so control
resumes immediately. No reconfiguration or key changes are needed.

**Tip for development / frequent reflashing:** after the first pairing, prefer
**OTA** for updates so the counter is preserved. If you deliberately erase to get
a clean device, just re-press PROG afterwards - otherwise "the motor stopped
responding" looks like a protocol fault when it's only counter drift.
